# Tarmarnian Text-to-Speech Translator

This project started out as a fun, quick, and simple web app to send to my friend for her birthday. 
A group of us worked together in the same restaurant, and to keep our chill and sanity we would speak in this fictional language that my friend had created, Tarmarnian. The basics of speaking the language is that most vowels are replaced with an 'ar' sound, and certain words like yes are replaced with the Tarmarnian equivilent, Yarbah!. 

The app functions as follows:
1. The phrase you want to translate into Tarmarnian is typed into the text input box
2. After clicking the purple translate button to the right of the input box, the translated text will appear below
3. To hear the browser speak the text in Tarmarnian, click the icon of the headphones

To use the app online you can use [this link right here](https://wisniewskiz.github.io/tarmarnian/). You can also download the source files and run it from your computer by opening the index.html file in your bowser.
